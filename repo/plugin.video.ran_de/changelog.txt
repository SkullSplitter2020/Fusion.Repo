3.0.1
- Bugfix by Linkinsoldier: Addon was no longer usable on Kodi Nexus because of deprecated function call

3.0.0
- Complete Rewrite of Addon by Linkinsoldier&Maven based on Mavens ProSiebenSat1 Addon Version 1.3.0 (which initially included ran.de section)
- This new Addon includes the Videos from the Website and therefore should always include ALL available Videos in the ran Sports Section
- just to be sure, this Addon also includes the "ran" entries from the ProSieben, ProSieben MAXX and Sat1 media library 
    and the Livestreams from ProSieben/ProSieben MAXX/Sat1 - Thanks to being based on the ProSiebenSat1 Addon. 
    It can easily include other ProSiebenSat1 channels in the future (currently no ran content on this channels)
- this Addon still includes the old API content in the last bullet point "ran Sports aus der alten APP API" to "ensure maximum content"

THANKS to PUR3 for the old Addon with the ran API Source. It has been of good use for the past 5 years 
    - now lets hope this Addon will give us joy for the next five years!
